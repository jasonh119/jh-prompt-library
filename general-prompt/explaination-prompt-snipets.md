** Assess your response **
I want you to assess your response against this checklist. Rate your answer on a scale of 1-10 for each of these criteria: accuracy, completeness, relevance, clarity, and practical usefulness. For any score below 8, explain what's missing and provide an improved version that would score higher. Based on what you know about me, make sure the response aligns with my needs and preferences

** Justify your answer **
For each main point in your response, explain your reasoning process. What evidence supports each conclusion? What assumptions did you make? Where might your answer be contentious or uncertain? If you need more information from me to provide a higher-quality answer, specify exactly what details would help you improve the accuracy

** Tell me what you need **
Before giving me any answer, point out exactly what I've left out of my request. Tell me what specific details would make my prompt clearer. Ask me 2-3 direct questions about information you need to give me the best possible answer, and wait for my response before continuing

** What angles am I missing? **
Review my request and tell me what angles I'm completely missing. What would someone with an opposite viewpoint consider? What three questions would an expert in this field ask that I haven't thought about? Push my thinking beyond my comfort zone, then help me create a more complete picture of the situation before answering my original question

** Raise the bar to world-class **
Based on what you know about my business goals, I want you to respond to my question as if you were in the top 1% of experts in my field. First, tell me what a world-class response would include that most responses don't. Make sure to include nuances, counter-intuitive insights, and advanced strategies that only someone with extensive experience would know. What would the absolute best in the field do differently from the average practitioner?
